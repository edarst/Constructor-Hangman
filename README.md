# Constructor-Hangman
Built using constructor functions, this hangman games allows the user to play hangman entirely through node.

The user enters a letter as they're presented with blank template. Letters populate in the spaces if the letter matches one of the words in the array.

They user has ten guesses. If they run out, the game ends and they're prompted to play again.

CURRENT ISSUES:

* No functionality, code is currently in placeholder state for future work
